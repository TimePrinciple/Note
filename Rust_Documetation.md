Good documetation is not natural. There are opposing goals that make writing good documentation difficult. It requires expertise in the subject but also writing to a novice perspctive. Documentations therefore often glazes over implementation detail, or leaves reader unanswered questions.

The power of command-line tools really comes to shine when you are able to combine them. This is not a new idea: In fact, this is a sentence from the Unix philosophy:

> Expect the output of every program to become the input to another, as yet unknown, program.

Not all people are in front of terminals, who are able to read text and reason about its meaning.
